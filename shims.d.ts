    This is a library written for the Maxim MAX30105 Optical Smoke Detector
    It should also work with the MAX30102. However, the MAX30102 does not have a Green LED.
    These sensors use I2C to communicate, as well as a single (optional)
    interrupt line that is not currently supported in this driver.
